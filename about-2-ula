memory management
	in ia32 , memory directly mapped into kernel only less than 1gb , so others are controlled by
		high memory , and mem  above 4gb can only be controlled by cpu's PAE extension , 
		and everytime can only control 4gb ,
	
	high memory :
		this problem only happens on 32bit cpus , and only when kernel want to access
			memory above 896mb, because kernel always map physical page directly 
			into kernel space and not use the page table model the user space used .
			so this is not problem  for userspace programs , they always use page
			tables ,and that pagetable always have values valid
	numa:
		distribute computer, multi-cpus have their own mem , but access other cpus mem through
			qpi channel , will be a little slower.  when core are too many , access to mem
			from bus can be a bottleneck , so numa maybe better
