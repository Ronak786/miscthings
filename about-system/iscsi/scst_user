init_scst_user:
	create kmem cache for user cmd and user dev
	static create a dev_user_devtype for user scst
	call scst_register_virtual_dev_driver for it:
		add into scst_virtual_dev_type_list this strcut
		create a kobj under handlers/ named scst_user
			create mgmt under that dir and because no add_device function,
			so use pass through method for this attr: scst_devt_pass_through_mgmt
				and this will have no use , because it search list which will
				be used by other modules, not scst_user
			create default attrs
	create a scst_user class under /sys/class
	create a chrdev scst_user with dev_user_fops as its ops
	create a device scst_user under that class, so under /dev we have a chrdev /dev/scst_user
	run a scst_usr_cleanupd thread with function dev_user_cleanup_thread()
		which will check the cleanup_list, do dev_user_process_cleanup() with arg scst_user_dev

	END, so I think the most interesting place in this mod is the /dev/scst_user's ioctl function
