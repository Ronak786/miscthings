user space:(during this period, we will have a connection struct exist along all time until discovery end
		this struct will save current processing state in state machine)
	initiator:
		send a write data, including discovery infos,and some params(don't know what usage)
		then wait for data to come
		after getting data, again send ,this time, with SendTargets=All,then again wait,
		after get data,close socket
	target: (get poll_in state)receive fd,get data,check data,opcode is login 
		(get poll_out state)send above data to initiator
		(get poll_in state)receive data and opcode is text scan
			target_build_list() to scan target that can be logined in, (call into kernel)
		(get poll_out state) send target name and addr to initiator, again wait
		(get poll_hup also others, revent is 25), try read but no data, so change to STATE_DROP,
			destroy connection, discovery end


kernel space:
	get ioctl ISCSI_INITIATOR_ALLOWED:
	iscsi_initiator_allowed:, this only check if initiator is allowed to attach this target,
		so discovery can return this target
