iozone's direct on client is better?  
block size bigger than 512k 1024k or more ???
	the true bottle neck is wirte into one swgfs file, but if using too many  threads to 
	write, will cost more(thread sum: 7 work, four rw file ??, or I should range thread sum
	into less than cpu num, so while open thread, check, so global thread not a good idea)

update scst 3.2


_FILE_OFFSET_BITS ==> __USE_FILE_OFFSET64
modify /usr/include/sys/statfs64.h struct statfs {}  signed long into unsigned long

sg_ses --dev-slot-num=0 --clear=fault /dev/sg14

/usr/bin/ceph-mon -f --cluster ceph --id x86_storage1 --setuser ceph --setgroup ceph to start ceph mo instead of systemd

look at the ceph/guide of gentoo !!!!
ceph osd too less: ceph osd pool set rbd pg_num 128

remember to touch /var/lib/ceph/mon/ceph-node1/{done,systemd}  !!!!

osd name too long:  osd max object name len = 256  should use xfs instead of ext4
					osd max object namespace len = 64

all owner should be ceph !!!
