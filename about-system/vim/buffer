edit:
	vim edit by modifying mem mapping of file, until :w, just in mem
	:ls to see all opened file
		the file headed with "%" is cur file
		the file headed with "#" can be switched to and forth with <c-^>
	:bn bp to iterate
	:bf :bl to first and last
	:b number to one file
	:b <tab> to iterate all opened file  useful !!

	use nnoremap to remap some button for you!!
	:n,m bd  to delete buffer from n to m or just use 1 2 3 4 5 bd

args:
	open a vim, :args  xx xx  then you can open multi files at onetime,(:e can not do this)
	 you can use this to add multi files into opened vim buffer
	 glob
		 use args *.*  **/*.*  ** will search in subdir
	use arglist:
		args `cat listfilename`  then content of file will be recognized as
			filenames, in `` you can use any shell comnd,so is powerful
		iterate:
			use :next :prev to iterate

	hidden buffer:
		if not set autowrite, modify one buffer, will not allow switch to another buffer,
			should use :bn!  to switch forcely
		when :q, will notify you to write  them or ignorethem
			use :wa! to write, use  :qa! to quit and ignore all,
			use :e! to revert content to mem and will cause no change
			:wn  write current to disk and open next to edit
			:argdo {command} this will do ex-command on each windown in arglist
			set hidden  will allow you to use :bn to switch among modified buffers

split window;
	<c-w>s  :sp	  -
	<c-w>v  :vsp  |
	:sp filename  to split and load a new file
	<c-w>w  to iterate all windows
	hold <c-w> not pop press  w or j k h l will move to diff direction's window !!
	<c-w>o  to reverse only cur window and close others
	<c-w>c to close cur window
	n<c-w>_ to max height of cur window, if has n , the n is real height
	n<c-w>| to max width of cur window
	<c-w>= to make all win same size
	see help: window-moving

	<c-w> n-/+ to decrease/inc cur win height
	<c-w> n</> to inc/dec width

tab:
	lcd to set cur activate WINDOW's file's locate dir
	:tabe  filename open a new file on a new tab
	:tabc  close current tab
	:tabo  close until only current exist
	:tabn number   Ngt		Nth tab
	:tabn			gt		next tab
	:tabp			gT    previous tab
	<c-w>T  move cur window to a new tab(only valid on a multiwindow tab
	:tabm N move tab to Nth pos, default is tail , :tabm 0 is head
