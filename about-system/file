:pwd to print cur dir
:e xxx to open a file to edit
in ex-command:
	% is currentfile's complete relative path
	and %:h is that path remove the  file name,so only dir name exist
	we remap that by %% so :%%  will expand to cur buffer's dir
	(only take effect when you are modifying a disk device)

:find xxx  
	using this , first :set path+=xxx/** to add a search dir and subdirs

<C-g> to check file's status

netrw:
	this is a stardard plugin, used to open dir instead of file
	use '-' to goto parent dir

	open current dir's content:
		:e.  :E
		:Se  :Ve used to open and create a window and put buf in that
	netrw is powerfull to even edit netstream files !! see :h netrw-% netrw-d netrw-del
															netrw-rename

	edit a not exist file and press <c-g> show status will see newfile, so
		:w used to write new file
	edit a not exist file with a not exit dir, should use :!mkdir -p %:h (expand to curr buf's dir),
		then :w

	write in super user mode:
		after write, :w !sudo tee % > /dev/null
		this will take curfile's buffer' content as input , tee into %(cur file on disk)
		and ask you to input passwd just like sudo !!
