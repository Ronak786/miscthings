problems:
	now if use linux instead of linux16, kernel will at 16M instead of 1M,(grub also use 1M place,
		so this place hit twice when linux16), but use linux, when want to attach decompressed
		kernel with 0x1000000,will signal,
		when use linux16,everything right, just set arch i386:x86-64:intel


take x86 as example:
	first  compile kernel , set debuginfo,
	second qemu -kernel xxx -s -S 
	3, gdb , target remote :1234  , set arch i8086 
	4 , hbreak *0x100000 , now you will in the compressed directory's header.S's firstline: startup_32 !!

mbr and bootloader:
	use qemu is also available, dd make a img, fdisk to make part, 
	then losetup /dev/loop0 img, losetup /dev/loop1 img -o (2048*512)'s value, 
	then mkfs,  mount loop1 , grub-install --root-directory=/mnt --modules="part_msdos, ext2 ,normal"
		/dev/loop0, then copy vmlinz into boot, and make a grub menu , 
		then you can qemu -hda xx -s -S to start debug and now you can break at mbr *0x7c00 !!

if you use linux xxx in  gurb,
	in compressed part , startup_32 can be found by 0x100 0000 place(16M),
	but if use linux16, then startup_32 will in 0x10 0000(1M),
	and because CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START is 16M , both will be set to 16M as decompressed kernel start
		(and if relocatable is set in config, higher place can be set for kernel img)

startup_64: if you want to get here, remember set arch i386:x86-64:intel ,(because this is now 
	in long mode),break at16M ,and the responsibility of this function is to decompress kernel and jump
	to the kernel's startup_64
