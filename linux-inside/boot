when start power button, first check power stable , then motherboard will signal cpu
to run, then cpu reset cs 0xf000, cs base 0xffff0000  ip 0xfff0,until then next jump,cs base will
be used directly( normally cs decide the cs base , but at boot, the cs base is set manually)
so reset vector is in 0xfffffff0 , 4gb - 16byte.
