when start power button, first check power stable , then motherboard will signal cpu
to run, then cpu reset cs 0xf000, cs base 0xffff0000  ip 0xfff0,until then next jump,cs base will
be used directly( normally cs decide the cs base , but at boot, the cs base is set manually)
so reset vector is in 0xfffffff0 , 4gb - 16byte.

but when start , cpu is in real mode , so only 1M is accessible. so,
	in fact, 0xfffe 0000 -- 0xffff ffff is a map to the rom , then first instruction
	is in the rom.,and then  jmp, so cs now will not change,
	will always in bios rom and get instructions to run !!( no!!
		we will go a far jmp , and under 1MB,0xc8000--0xeffff(accurate is 0xf0000 
		and we also will have bios shadow area, whenever cpu access 0xffff xxxx,
		they will be redirected to the shadowed place in memory,(map 0xf0000 to that?)
	but the shadow will make those place unusable after that , so consume memory)

about memory map:
	when cpu send out address , the northbirdge decide where to route ,most will to ram ,
	but also some must be allocated for device and rom , so on 32bit system, you can not 
	use all 4g ram!!!(use /proc/iomem to lookup)(because device have their own memory)

	all address you send to cpu will be modified to segment type then send to bus

startup cpu:(only one cpu will be chose to run, other will activated by kernel)
	poweron , cpu exec bios , then read mbr , then load bootloader. bootloader with 2 stage 
	will use bios's interrupt to copy kernel image to 1M+,
	but now we are in real mode(can only access 1M) , so intel cpu has a unreal mode to switch from and to 
	by grub to do the copy job

windows: almost the same , but win's mbr only check partition's boot sector
	to get the bootloader,and its bootloader it combined with kernel boot code


kernel startup sequence:(after bootloader)(only one cpu will be chose to run all this when power on)
 bootloader have data write into kernel setup header, then jmp to kernel setup code's first code
this is under 1M , and seen in boot protocal(for communication with kernel and bootloader)
in arch/x86/boot/header.S , then arch/x86/boot/main.c(now real mode) , then jmp to protected mode(32bit)
then arch/x86/boot/decompress/head_64.S(startup_64), decompress kernel to 1M, then jmp to that
place and in arch/x86/kernel/head_64.S (startup_64), do paging ldt gdt idt setup , then
arch/x86/kernel/head64.c  -> init/main.c(start_kernel)

start_kernel:
	here we initialize all things , then rest_init, will fork a thread to do cpu_idle 
		as a pid 0 process
	then begin schedule and another part will get the /sbin/init to run and linux startup!!
