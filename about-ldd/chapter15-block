blockdev:
	[un]register_blkdev: get a devnumber of blockdev and an entry in /proc/devices

block_device_operations:
	open close ioctl: this has HDIO_GETGEO to get disk size
		lots of ioctl be handled by standard block system
	media_changed: 
		if changed media in driver
	revalidate_disk:
		after mediachanged, this is called 
	use add_disk for a gen_disk (including assign devno)
		then operation will take effect, no classcreate needed

	gendisk:
		#include <linux/genhd.h>
		major, firstminor, minors, diskname
		fops
		request_queue: use this to perform io
		capacity: using set_capacity() size_of_disk / KERNEL_SECTOR_SIZE(self defined)
		private_data: used and passed into your struct request

		use alloc_disk(minors) to alloc: this will set minors field
			del_gisk() to delete
		add_disk() : just like cdev_add()
	io handled by struct request
		init: queue = blk_init_queue(queue, spin_lock);
				gendidsk->queue = queue
			after init queue: use blk_queue_logical_block_size(dev->queue, hardsect_size);
				to tell kernel your block dev's true sector size
			set_capacity(gendisk, size_of_sector);
				set size of disk according to kernel's 512byte sector size	

		block_operation_ops:
			open: inode->i_bdev->bd_disk ==> your gendisk

		ioctl:
			driver/block/ioctl.c
			HDIO_GETGEO return sector stat

	request:
		use a method in blk_init_queue() to register your func into your queue
		in request function, you are in a spinlock , so do not sleep

		request called in a non process enviromment when kernel think it is good to
			run request on queue after collecting much of them

		1 : do with request
		blk_fetch_request(queue): get next unhandled request(will not dequeue)
			(this will end the request and free it)
				if error , __blk_end_request_cur(req, errno)

				next transferdata:
					start sector: blk_rq_pos(req)
					sectors :blk_rq_cur_sectors(req)
					databuffer: bio_data(req)
					direction: rq_data_dir(req) write or not

				__blk_end_request_cur(req, ret) ret 0 success
					then blk_fetch_request(queue) for next

		finally :blk_cleanup_queue

		2 : do with bio in request each:
			blk_fetch_request()
			__rq_for_each_bio() for each bio
			bio_for_each_segment() for each segment in bio(one segment is one bio_vec array member in bio)
			__bio_kmap_atomic()
			__bio_unkmap_atomic()
			
			after loop:
				__blk_end_request_all

			dma:
				blk_rq_map_sg() to map scatter-gether from request yourselves

		finally :blk_cleanup_queue

		3 : with your own make request: so do not reorder request
			queue = blk_alloc_queue();
			blk_queue_make_request()
			then request func will handle bio directly,
			and you must call bio_endio() for each bio

		finally : blk_put_queue
			
				

		blk_init_queue:
			init a request queue, and you can set your private data into queue
		blk_cleanup_queue:
			return queue to os, free mem
			
		blk_queue_ordered(queue, flag):
			tell queue that we sensitive to order, do not reorder them
		blk_barrier_rq() check if order flag is set on this request
		blk_noretry_request() :if true, do not retry  if fail, just ignore this request

	bio:
		a request is a bio, which has many bio_vec, according to different pages,
			but contingous in physical hard disk, so combine together by io scheduler
