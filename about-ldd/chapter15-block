blockdev:
	[un]register_blkdev: get a devnumber of blockdev and an entry in /proc/devices

block_device_operations:
	open close ioctl: this has HDIO_GETGEO to get disk size
		lots of ioctl be handled by standard block system
	media_changed: 
		if changed media in driver
	revalidate_disk:
		after mediachanged, this is called 
	use add_disk for a gen_disk (including assign devno)
		then operation will take effect, no classcreate needed

	gendisk:
		#include <linux/genhd.h>
		major, firstminor, minors, diskname
		fops
		request_queue: use this to perform io
		capacity: using set_capacity() size_of_disk / KERNEL_SECTOR_SIZE(self defined)
		private_data: used and passed into your struct request

		use alloc_disk(minors) to alloc: this will set minors field
			del_gisk() to delete
		add_disk() : just like cdev_add()
	io handled by struct request
