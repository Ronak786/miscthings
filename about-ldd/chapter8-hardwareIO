io use:
	diff cpu arch/version has diff io space or not,
	dif device use io mapped mem or use io space directly

barrier: used to make sure some op before func() must have been done
		avoid resort
	barrier() 
	[smp_]rmb() read done
	[smp_]wmb() write done
	[smp_]mb()	both done

	include<asm/system.h>
	set_mb()
	set_[r|w]mb()  set value and do a mb()

request io:
	/proc/ioports
	request_region(first, n, name); // used to annouse we are going to use these ports
	release_region
	check_region [ deprecated ]
	
io operation: see io.h
	inb outb inw outw

	userspace
		use ioperm iol to check permission
		use inb outb ... to do io operations

	pause io:
		intb_p outb_p ...


io memory operatoin:
	cat /proc/iomem
	should use io specific function 

	request_mem_region
	then addr = ioremap(phy_addr)
	use ioread8/16/32(addr)
	ioread8_rep () : used to read buffer of count bytes
	should used with wmb()

	memset_io
	memcpy_fromio
	memcpy_toio

	old methods:
		readb/w/l writeb/w/l  without check ,should not use

port remap as mem: need request_region first
	ioport_map
	ioport_unmap
