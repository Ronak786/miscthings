primary backup:
	sync:
		first commit to primary, wait it to get response from other nodes for consensus, thenreturn
	async:
		not wait, just return, a weak consensus, if network partition occurred

	practise:
		2pc(two phase commit):
			first maintainer ask  ok to commit to all others, return ok
			then do commit/roll back on all nodes
			cons:
				may block if network partition or node block

raft(easier paxos): majority vote
	on a network partition, majority part continue to work, minority part stop working

	roles:
		only one is leader, others are followers to monitor leader
		one proposer/leader, others are accptors/voters

	epoch:
		every node has a epoch number, partitioned node has smaller number,
		every operation done after a leader election and decide a bigger epoch
		electrion:
			if proposal value v chosen, higher value declined

	paxos
	zab: zookeeper 's method
	raft: easier than paxos, and same assurance
