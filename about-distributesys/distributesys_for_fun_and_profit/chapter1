scalability: handle growing of work in a capable manager or its ability to be enlarged to accomodate that growth
	size: more faster linearly(more power)
	geographic: reduce response time
	administrative: not increase cost of admin

performance: within fix resource do more useful work
	short response
	high throughput
	low utilization

latency: time bwtween things happed and things show
availability: proportional time system is in work
fault tolerance: can tolerate expected fault and handle it

prevents:
	as number enlarges, increase failure, communication cost, latency
	gain more performance by exposing more detail of this system, but lack abstraction

techniques:
	partition: more about locality optimize, releated data in one partition
	replication: replicate to avoid failure
