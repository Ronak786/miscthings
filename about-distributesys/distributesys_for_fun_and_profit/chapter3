order:
	total order 全序
		good , but time sync on different systems is difficult
	partial order 偏序

time:
	time is source of order, we can attach time to object to represent order

	time not always sync on all nodes, sync itself will cost if using global lock

	depend on accuracy time sync:
		facebook Cassandra
		Google Sapnner
	local clock:
		only local events can be ordered
	no clock:
		use time just as a point, interval concepts use internal counter and communication to replace
		so latency affect time calculate
			linkedlin's Voldemort
			BAsho 's Riak

	time can be used to keep global consistency
		used to detect high latency or failure
