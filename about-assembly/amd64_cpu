memory:
	long mode:
		64bit : cs(only attribute), fs, gs(only addr),  ds es ss (ignore, assume no use, just 0)
			virtual addr->paging->phy addr
		compatibility mode:
			addr + selector -> extending to 64bit -> paging -> phy addr 64bit

	legacy mode: 
		protected :  addr + selector(segmentation)->[paging] -> phyaddr 32bit
		virutal 8086 addr + selector (20bit) -> [paging] -> phyaddr 32bit
		real mode addr + selector (20bit) -> phyaddr 32bit (from 31 to 19 is 0)

	ip relative address offset:
		support 32bit +-, so +- 2GB offset

	near pointer : effective address (just the offset part)
	far pointer : selector + effective address
		these are the same in 64bit mode
