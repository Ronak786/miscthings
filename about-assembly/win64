in 64mode:
	mov  32bit into 64 register, will auto set higher part of 64 register to 0
	but mov 8/16bit into 64 will not affect higher part
	
	use movsxd to mov 32 signed into 64
	offset result in 64bit

	call win32 api:
		args pass by rcx ,rdx, r8 r9
		when use stack, after being called ,because pushed 8 byte address, you should also 
			sub 8byte, to align 16byte, 
			then before call subproc, sub 32byte as shadow place for ,then call,!!!
