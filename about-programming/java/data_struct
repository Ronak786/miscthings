bag:
    just a container, can add in items, but can not fetch out

iterable:
    this class used to implement inerator attr
    this has iterator class, you implement this in a subclass to implement truly iterator
    
    like:
        public class xxx<Item> implements Iterable<Item> { }
         in which we define a private class xxx<Item> implements Interator<Item>
            the xxx is the return value of Iterator method

            in which,we define a hasNext(),  a next() with return type Item and void remove()
