import and package:
the package aa.bb.cc.dd is just a pkg name,
	classes belonged to same pkg should have this command at the first statement of that file
	if you use this , you can use every function in this pkg without import(static method must 
		use import static or  use class.func to invoke)
import  used if you do not belong to that pkg,
	import aa.bb.cc.dd.class-name(or just .*)
	then you can use class and functions in that pkg directly,otherwise you must use aa.bb.cc.cc.class.name

when compile , just javac xxxx is enough,
	but when run, you should use the whole pkg's path if your current class file also belong to that pkg
		otherwise , just jave xxx to run

	总结 if use package xxx, then when run, should use java  aa.bb.cc.dd.file  or aa/bb/cc/dd/file
			but your actually file need not under that filesystem 层级
