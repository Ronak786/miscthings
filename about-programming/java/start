    }

compile:
    javac xxx.java
run:
    java xxx

check style:
    checkstyle-algs4
    should have a header /*****

        method overload, (use with diff type of args)

    static main( this can be in every java file as a test unit)

recursive:
    1 base case
    2 every call should have smaller date range than prev
