how to write java:
    public class filename {

    }

compile:
    javac xxx.java
run:
    java xxx

check style:
    checkstyle-algs4
    should have a header /*****
                          *****/  have 78 * and one /

search path:
    java -cp "xxxxxx" xx.xx.xx.filename   to specify and run

print:
    use + in () to concate var with string
        this will convert another member into a string(just call toString)
        具体的加法变成字符串的顺序是按照符号的顺序的
    can use string conversion in println instead of printf

input:
    in java, input start from args[0] is the first, diff from C!!!
    how to read from commandline?, just use args[xxx], 

    StdIn input only can read file(ofcourse !!, if want value, use pipe to pass)
    In  also read from file, url .. , if want value, just use args
        the argc is String[].length!!! and not include filename !!

TYPE:

    signed unsigned:
        in java, no unsigned type, and >> use 1 if leftmost is 1,
                                       >>> use 0 just as unsigned !!

    char bype:
        char is 16bit unicode unsigned,
        bype is 8bit signed, and all characters represented by char
    Array:
        int [][]a = new int[m][n]; will auto initialize to 0 or 0.0
            declare can use vars 
        int a[] int[] a both right, but int[] a is clearer

    String:
        primitive type also have corresponding String type Integer which 
            have toString method


    double:
        infinity initialize: Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY  Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY
        a/0.0 will result in a value of Infinity

    boolen:
        in printf, use %b or %B to output

calculate:
    a/b will round ==> 0, (no matter positive or negative), then a%b will be a - a/b * b
    if use 'a' + 'b', 
        first level up to integer, then, add, so result is an int number!!,
        if you want char character in println or printf, use (char)(xxxxx) to convert force

    example:
        java is convinient,   s = "" ; for(n = N; n > 0; n/=2) s = n % 2 + s;  to convert to binary
            also use Integer.toBinaryString(N) is directly

command:
    In.readInts to readin all args
    parseInt to readin one int

static method:
    public static double name (double c)

    property:
        arg pass by value
        method overload, (use with diff type of args)

    static main( this can be in every java file as a test unit)

    instance method used with instance vars, static method used with class names (not bind to specific
        instance)

recursive:
    1 base case
    2 every call should have smaller date range than prev
    3 should not overlap data range between two call

library:
    a file, a public class filename, inwhich are static methods
    static method can be called from outside

    java.lang.Math
    java.util.Arrays
