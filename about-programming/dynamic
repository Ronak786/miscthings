gcc -fPIC -shared -o xxx   yyy
	.so have no address, because address decided by loading

relocate when link:
	this is what we do previous when use ld
	after this, in elf exec file,we have all symbol resoluted

relocate when load:
	old time do this, because can not decide where to load,
	so not reloate when link, but do it when load
	(use -shared but not use -fPIC)
