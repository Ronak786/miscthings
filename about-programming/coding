judge double_word: readin, test if eof or space : if so,continue reading until not so.( remember record newline)
			   test if a alpha: if so , continue reading until not, (remember ungetc the over read one) , 

const:
	use const with ADT, eg. typedef struct T *T, then in func:  void fun(const T stk);
		now the pointer to struct T is a const, because of the typedef,
		so here shoud use void fun(const struct T *stk);

void *:
	in C , void *also can be assign a pointer of func, but should be careful,not used better;
	use this to convert between two different type is not recommended

atom: 
	a method to store strings(can include '\0' in it), 
	make a hash , then store every string in that(if not exist,and return the ptr)
	so every string only have one copy

hash:
	simple one: h = 0; h = (h<<1) + scatter[i]; h %= length;
		scatter is an array of random integers
