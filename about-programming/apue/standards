ansi ,iso
	ansi make in 1989 the first C specification
	iso confirm that and become iso1990, then iso99, ios2011,

posix:
	begin by ieee, include operating system interface 
							shell && utilities
							single unix spec
							and a lot, we talk about this in book
	susv4 :
		single unix specification v4 in 2010, we refer to 

limits:
	compile limit: in header files <limits.h>
	runtime file/dir limit: pathconf()
	runtime sys limit: sysconf()
	eg. FOPEN_MAX, TMP_MAX, FILENAME_MAX,  
	note : 一般变量本身可能会定义在头文件里，但是其实真正运行时获取的是系统限制,这个才是有用的，
		如果没有的话就是用系统的了

	use get conf:
		first use eviron's conf, cpp -dM /dev/null can see that,
		then if not defined ,use sysconf to get, if
		can not get and errno == 0, means not defined,
		then assign your guessed var

		use setrlimit to set limit for your process use

	unistd.h:
		in it we have posix vars defined we can use 

	define _POSIX_C_SOURCE to make compile only include posix comaptible code

	sys/types.h
		we have special types for some vars
