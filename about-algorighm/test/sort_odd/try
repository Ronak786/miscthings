1: set index of odd number into an array x, save this array as y;
sort array x use key as original number in that index
put content of x according original index in y into original vector array

2: (wrong, even num place already changed)remember in a vector odd,
   normally sort
   scan sorted array, if detect even num, replace vector number into that

3: record odd pos slot in a vector x, do a copy of x to y, run sort on that y,
		set y into original vector according position info in x
   => success: ten test 1400ms,

4: create an array of pointer, point to odd numbers,
	just swap those pointed data

5:(clever):
	copy out odd numbers, sort them, copyback into odd position
