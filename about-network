use lspci -v to see ethernet card  and the modules loaded
use ipcalc -nb XX(ip addr)  -s 1  to show the spedified ip's netmask and boradcast

use macchanger  or ip link  set dev XX  address XXX  to set ethernet
	also can use in a systemd file   .link in then [Link] , also  in a udev file

when you do each below , you must shut down all other network applications , otherwise they will conflict
	and when needed , you MUST reboot !!!!

use  ip  utils to set network manually every time:

	ip link  set XX up/down to operate network
	ip addr add XXX/netmast   broadcast XXX    dev XX
	ip route  add default via XXX

	when clean
	ip addr flush dev XXX
	ip route flush dev XX 



use systemd-netwokd to set up network
	enable the systemd-networkd and systemd-resolved.servive  , the first will read your conf file ,
		and the second will resolve the dns
	then you make a soft link of /run/systemd/resolv/resolv.conf to /etc/resolv.conf
	then you can put your conf file in the /etc/systemd/network/ , with  .network as suffix
	content:
		[Match]
		Name=XXX
		Host=
		Virtulization=

		[Link]
		MACAddress=
		MTUBytes=

		[Network]
		DHCP=ipv4
		DNS=( can set multipul)
		
		[Address]
		Address=XXX/xx
		[Roure]
		Gateway=XX
	
	then you restart the service  or just reboot

use dhcpcd  ( a dhcp client daemon)
	first pacman -S dhcpcd
	then you can launch dhcpcd  or  use systemctl start dhcpcd   or systemctl start dhcpcd@interface;  the last is recommmended
	append  -t 0   to  wait all the time , otherwise will fail if no cable is plugged
	the conf file is /etc/dhcpcd.conf  ,  and have hook scripts in /usr/lib/dhcpcd/dhcpcd-hooks and /usr/share/dhcpcd/hooks( this place must link a soft link to the prev place)
		
	you can also  set a static conf in dhcpcd.conf :   
		static  XX(name)
		static ip_address=xxx/xx
		static router=xxx
		statid domain_name_servers=xxx(dns)
	and static as fallback

		profile  XX(name)
		static ip_address=xxx/xx
		static router=xxx
		statid domain_name_servers=xxx(dns)
	
		interface  xx
		fallback   xx(name)   this is used for a fallback ,  if the dhcp not worked

use netctl
	copy  conf files in /etc/netctl/examples/  into /etc/netctl  and modify  , 
		we have static  dhcp  ,  wpa  .... a lot con files
	use netctl start  filename( no path)  to start , 
		netctl enabel/reenable to  enable startup connection and reload

if you want to do with wireless

iwconfig  to see
iw dev XX scan | less to show all access points
and ip link set XX up to start up 
then use wpa_supplicant   to access 
	the passwd is encrypted by wpa_passwd
