page table: 
	with 64bit, we have 46bit can use , in arch/x86/include/asm/page_64_types.h, we
	can see pgd shift 39, pud 30, pmd 21(2M), pte 12,
	then kernel virtual addr's first addr is 0xffff ffff 8000 0000, 
		that is the last of pgd, the last two of pud,then whole of subs.
in kernel/head_64.S:
	when setup early kernel page , we static set pgd's last entry and pud's last two entry
	and pmd's 512M entry to map the first 512M from 0x0,(also fixmap 1 page is set)
	
	then we set pgd's head place with the true _text~_end as pagetable's ident map,
	so now we have virtual map from  0xffff ffff 8000 0000 to physical 0x0 at the bottom place 
		in early page table, and ident map at the table's head place

	then we set bottom's 512M map to add the delta value(kernel relocated)
