the main mkinitcpio  conf file is /etc/mkinitcpio.conf

in it:
MODULES: modules loaded before anything else done, so add all modules you needed , suffix ? can shut down errors when no module found

others can also seen in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf

every hook in runtime (/usr/lib/initcpio/hooks) has a build hook in the build directory
	when mkinitcpio , the build hooks will be run , can add runtime hooks into the image
	then runtime has three types : pre , run , late ,   and cleanup  when image is to down


now analyse some  hooks:
build hooks;
base: add busybox and kmod and all their links , add blkid , mount and switch_root(busybox's may not work well)
	add init and init_function (have functinos init will use)
	add modprobe option for usb , echi must before uhci and ochi
