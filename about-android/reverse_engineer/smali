in object method call:
	iput-object v0(dest register), v1(current class this), class->Filed:type


inner class:
	this$0  outerest class
	this$1 this$2 step from outer to inner

annonimous class:
	will use  Mainactivity$1.smali   something like this

switch:
	packed-switch p0, offset
		at current_pos + offset ,we have a switch data struct tells us
			how many cases and their key value and their target offset 
			from current_pos
	sparsed-switch 
		this cases not sequence numbers

try catch:
	will have some virtual try block for catch in catch block


reverse_engineer:
	find key words, key functions like finish killProcess()
