normal uid used as application id, 
	physical uid is 0 for the first user,  every user has private data in /data/system/user/<id>
	uid maintinaed by kernel, further detail permission claimed in androidmanifest.xml

every app runs in its uid scope, so access is denied from others

selinux forces white list, only allowed then can access
