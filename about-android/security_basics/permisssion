normal permission : like net_stat ...  granted auto default when install package
dangerous permisssoin: read_sms ... granted when confirmed by you from screen
	signature: most strict, only same cert can share
	signature or system: after 4.4, only package under /system/priv-app can share

permission check:
	higher layer: check package manager
	lower layer: check uid supplimentary gid
	access system resource: check calling process's uid gid

	socket: use socket(fd, sol_socket, so_peercred, xxxx) to get remote 's uid gid .. .to check

permisssion == gid:
	every embeded permission is a gid, defined as a groupname in android_filesystem_config.h,
	then in /etc/permisssion/platform.xml permisssion is binded by groupname,
	<assign_permisssion> used to assign permisssion to special uid processes(mostly system process)

when start a app:
	set supplimentary gid (permisssion)
	set limit of resource
	set uid gid euid egid
	set capabilities
	set schedule policy
	set process name ...

supplimentary gid AND linux capabilities:
	aid_net_raw == cap_net_raw
	aid_net_admin == cap_net_admin   This is the true nature of permisssion to system resource
		in include/linux/andorid_aid.h
