kernel can be preempted , or not , use a config to control

if not preempt , only interrupt can interrup the process , only process it self can use schedule to yield

preempt:
	now we support preempt  not only at returninig to userspace from kernel space or interrupt space ,
		but also in kernel whenever if it is safe: 
	safe:
		not in interrupt context ,
		not have spin type lock(set in thread_info's count )
	flag: need_resched
	when to set: every time in kernel
	when to check:
		wakeup a process
		new created a process
		enable preempt
		leave from interrupt 
		leave to userspace
		change priority
		when smp load balance
