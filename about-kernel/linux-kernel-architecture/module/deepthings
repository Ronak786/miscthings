EXPORT_SYMBOL_xxx:
these macros export symbol  sym,
	first, put that string into a __kstrtab_sym  char array into __ksymtab_strings section in .ko
	second, put  a kernel_symbol struct with field{name(above), address} into __ksymtab section
if EXPORT GPL, the second section will be __ksymtab_gpl

what's in elf header:
how many sections, their section header's place, every header's entry size,
	every section's off from start,
	all strings in elf file acctually stored in .strtab  .shstrtab(for section name),
	elf header's shstrndx give .shstrtab's index, then every section header's name(also a index)
		gives the index in that string table 

	eg. all things in __ksymtab section will be linked and put in 
		__ksymtab section and between variable __start___ksymtab, __stop___ksymtab
		these  stat stop symbols also declared and used in include/linux/module.h
