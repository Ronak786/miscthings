task_struct has three type of pids for different namespace, 
	in fact, they are all process ids , you can select type
	to choose the struct pid, 
struct pid:
	this is a struct contains several struct upid which 
		represent diff ids of the same process(with a global pid)
		in diff namespace, (all other ids will direct to
			one process's pid),with level ,you can get
			your local pid

local pid and namespace:
	calculate hash number, then you can get struct upid,
		use container_of , get struct pid, 
		with type info , get one of the struct task_struct
		use that struct pid

when alloc_pid in copy_process , we will allocate every local
	pid for every namespace parent , also add hash (nr, ns)
	into pid_hash
