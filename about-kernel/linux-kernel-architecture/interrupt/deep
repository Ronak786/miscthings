arch dependent  intr handle:
	when extern irq happened, firsrt assembly work to judge
 		it is a hardware intr, then call common interrupt,
		in which will save regs and intr vector in ax, then 
		call do_IRQ, 
	do_IRQ:
		this will get irqnum from ax saved reg struct
		and call handle_IRQ, 
		then get irq_desc and call your installed func
			or __do_IRQ()  for generic acknowlegde and also call your irq func

irq_hander:
	use set_irq_handler/ set_irq_chained_handler(shared)  to set first level irq handler,

take handle_edge_irq as example:
		if no irq func, just ack and return
		if current is running irq handler, set pending and mask and ack and return
		ack this irq using chip's action
		set in process flag
		check if it is second pending, then clear flag (only happen in handle_irq_event(),only in this will enable irq)
		run handle_IRQ_event() to do with your irq func
		check if pending when running above func, if is ,again do interrupt func

	handle_IRQ_event(): action:
		use request_irq to set second level irq handler,
		this handle_IRQ_event() will just enable irq if not specific specified to disable,
		then call every func registered on that irq line and check return value,
		do with every func and return when everyone is tested to run

		then irq func will return thread_wake for top func to wake up a pre registered thread
		in request_threaded_irq

request_irq:
	this func will register your func( or also thread) into that irq line,
	first will do some check, 
	if no one had registerd on that line:
		assign your func, create your thread if needed, set irq type(high low rising falling)
	if not emtpy:
		if your requested flag and irq type not consisten with existing one,
		you can not register


soft irq:  array is  softirq_vec[]
	only called when hardirq is being over, and now we are not in an interrupt(no a resursive one),
	we call invoke_softirq ,which will frist disable irq, then call _do_softirq to truly do softirq,
	in _do_softirq:
		first enable irq, then do all softirqs ,then disable irq, 
		check pendings(will happen when open irq),if not too many times ,again
		do irq
	during all these, we will disable softirq
