request_irq to get irq,

check:
	/proc/interrupt /proc/irqnumber/ /proc/stat

check what irq is used(for old devs):
one:
	mask = probe_irq_on
	cause your irq
	irq = probe_irq_off(mask)
	if (irq <= 0)
		do again;
	else success !!

two:
	install on all irqs that have not been installed
	cause your irq
	in irq handler, check which irq, then free_irq others

SA_INTERRUPT: fast interrupt,if this , when doing interrupt,
	all other interrupts on this cpu will be forbidded

	in interrupt, kernel will normallly acknowleged,then
	check if handler is installed, if so , call it

disable_irq
enable_irq  to disable one specific irq ( can be called recursively)

local_irq_save local_irq_disable to disable all irq on local cpu
local_irq_restore local_irq_enable to enable
