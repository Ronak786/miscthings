scsi : a protocal,  usually have a host, sata,usb also use scsi command ,
	linux virtualize a scsi host for them
	use scsi_host_alloc to allocate a virtual scsi host struct 
		to represent a scsi host card
	here usb use scsi command , so we use scsi layer to do info transmit
		a scsihost relate to a scsi_host_template

	in usb probe , scsi will make two threads , one for conf , second for scan
		the second one will scan the host we just virtualized, then exit

	the scan thread exit quickly , but the control thread will is the entry of
		all other work of usb storage!!


in system , all block device operations are transferred into scsi command by sd_mod /scsi_mod,
	then under that , if you are a ata device , the libata will be used to 
	transfer that into ata instruction ?
