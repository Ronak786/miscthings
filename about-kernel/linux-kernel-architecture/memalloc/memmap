devices has registers and mem(rom)'s that can be read or write by system,
	in computer, these resource mapped to two kinds: io space and memspace,

io port:
	these are registers that mapped to io space,(only exist in x86 serials)
	in linux ,these are just port numbers ,addr range from 0 to 64k
	access:
		request_region-> inb outb ... ->relese_region
	or:
		request_region->ioport_map->readb ....
		->ioport_unmap->release_region
	the latter method just change the io port number into
		a proper addr in in vritual addr,so can be accessed 
		by ioread8 iowrite32...

io mem:
	mapped by hardware, so we have physical addr of these resources,
	then request_mem_region ->ioremap->ioread8 iowrite32 ...->iounmap
		->release_mem_region

	in ioreadxxx  ,this func will judge if it is a ioport or iomem 
	and call specific func to get or set vals

ioread_8_rep ,continously read from that address count times
memset_io
memcpy_fromio
memcpy_toio   these three read/write from a range of address of io mem
