work_flow:
alloc_tty_driver to alloc a driver struct with specific minor devices
set some fields necessary: name flag, type...
set tty_operations : open close write set_termios ...

tty_register_driver: if fail , put_tty_driver
tty_register_device : for every device number belongs to that driver

in tty_driver: 
	struct termios : match  user space's settermios
	open: when open, get a tty_struct attached to that device,
	close : do opposite to open
	write: get data from tty core subsys and transfer to tty hardware.
	no read func, driver will pass data to core whenever available.

so three main struct:
	tty_driver
	tty_struct
	tty_operations
	and other ioctls...  these will be passed to driver
