if want to write ioctl:
first choose a type character,
then use _IO _IOW _IOR _IOWR to suggest which type
	of comminucation you want
	(both in userspace and kernel should
		be the same)
write your ioctl func and assign to file operation,
	use unlocked_ioctl just good

then you can call and do your thing

including file:
	user: stropts.h , linux/ioctl.h
	kernel: uapi/asm-generic/ioctl.h
