NOT READING VERY GOOD, NEED A THIRD TIME READ!!
schedule:
	relatime time: fifo, rr
	normal :
policy:
	n(1): multiple list of each priority

priority:
	static priority is 140 to 100(highest), dynamic used by scheudler calculated from static one,
	interactive and blocked ones has higher priority, so response time is short, but run duration
	should not too long in case of same priority

	real-timepriority used for readtime processes to be scheduled first before normal processes,
		but the time for run determined by its static and dynamic priority

queue:
	every cpu has active and expired queue, processes timeout its time slice and not interactive
		or expire proceess too long will then put into expire queue

schedule:
	positive: process call schedule(), so will search queue for a run process
	passive: set need reschedule flag in thread_info, so will check when timer interrupt return(user or kernel)

	time:
		when timer interrupt or some one waked up

domain:
	rebalance and migration kernel thread in each runqueue will take responsibility for balance 
	processes on each cpu for load balance
