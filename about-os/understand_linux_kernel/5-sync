preempt:
	when in an kernel exception(like syscall), func may be preempted by another function,
	checkpoint usually in interrupt
nonpreempt:
	even if higher priority process wakeup, only when return to user or self relax cpu will
	cause process switch

per-cpuvar:
	every var for each cpu, and every area align to cache line start, so do not invalidate each other.
	should preempt disable when access, so use get_cpu_var()
	but interrupt also can corrupt it?
	useful to cpu specific data process

aotmic:
	use lock prefix to make sure other cpu can not access before next instrument executed
mem barrier:
	used to make sure instrument before must be done before instrument after this barrier
spin lock:
	inside spinlock, will disable preempt, disable irq also if you needed
	when waiting:
		can be preempted
		keep checking loop

rw lock:
	read ,write use same integer, different bit range to represent
semaphore
rwsemaphore
rcu
seqlock
completion
local_irq_save disable interrupt on local cpu, but concurrent may happend on different cpu in interrupt
local_bh_disable : disable softirq on local cpu
	
some concurrent enviromments:
	in exception: semaphore
	in softirq: use disable_local_bh for (tasklet, but for softirq, additionally use spinlock because
			softirq can run sametime on multiple cores)
	in interrupt: use spinlock if multiple core and multiple interrupt handler will handle that struct
				otherwise just nothing, because same interrupt only do once at one time
	both exception and interrupt: spinlock needed, or semaphore(but interrupt should use loop + downtrylock)
