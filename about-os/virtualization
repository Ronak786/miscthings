cpu:
	at boot time, set trap table and a timer interrupt, 
	so we can schedule when syscall is made, or when a timer interrupt occurred,
		avoiding infinite loop hang the cpu
	
	switch_context:
		first timer interrupt interrupt the user, then trap into kernel, save user register into kernel stack of 
		that process by kernel switch mode automatically, then in timer handler decide if schedule() should action, 
		if yes, do context_switch: 
			save and restore kernel statck and register of each process, then in context switch, then "ret" will
			return to new process's last executed code

	fork and exec and wait:
		use fork and extc to make new process,
		use wait to get finished process's status and clean it in processlist of stopped status

scheduler:
	1. singlely meature turnaround(finishe) time:
		each time new task come, measure whose end time is short, run it until end, 
		but commonly we do not know end time
	2. roundrobin
		good to interactive task, good respond time, but bad turnaround time

	3. multiple level priority scheudler: Windows NT
		every time come, priority is highest, 
		each one run atmost a specific time, then forcely release cpu, or io-intense task can release itself,
		if one task runs a specific time on one priority, down it priority to another level
			each level has different most-run-time
		every period time boost process to highest again avoiding starvation


	4 proportional scheudler:
		1. using random:
			each process assign some tickets, each time schedule, get a random number,choose the process to run
				who has this nuber as ticket, using probability to make sure this is fare
		2 using stride: this is an inverse of tickets
			each time after run, add that stride, then next time choose the lowest add-on stride's process to run.


	multicore-scheduler:
		1 must make sure cache coherent using some hardware technique (bus monitor)
		2 single-queue shedule: 
			simple implement, but queue operation code need mutex which cost lot
		3 multiple quue each a cpu core, no lock, but some cpu will starve, so migration of process is need 
			and monitor needed, which need a proper interval time to set and analysis
			
		
memory:
	implement for each process:
		efficient, transparent, protection
	
	1 use base and limits regiter(hardware) as MMU
		once loaded program, set base and limit, each time fetch instrument or fetch data,
		check limit first and add base to that addr
		if over limit, hardware will jump to exception which set at boot time

		when context switch, save base and limit, 
		when move in mem of process, just change base and limit,
		THIS IS CALLED DYNAMIC ALLOCATION
		
	2 segmentation:
		only one base is too wasteful, as space between heap and stack no use , but must alloc
		so we can use multiple base and limit for each piece of code, heap, stack
			eg. we can use first two bit of virtual addr as segment flag, otherbits as offset into that segment,
			also add protection bits in segment descriptor, add grow direction, then
			segs can be used by multiple programs

		defects:
			we have external waste pieces after allocation. need some policy to find free mem in a list,
			heap also can be too large when not needed, so segmentation also not too good
