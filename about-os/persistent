disk operation:
	interface:
		status command data register to control
	internal:
		disks each has two phase, which has many tracks,
			which as many sectors
		disk head seek arond track: seek time
		wait for sector : roration time

	internal policy:
		depend on seek and rotation time which is less
	outer  os policy:
		elevator algorithm, avoid starve
		merge request, increase io throughput
