misc
	if you not want to change line after one print,
	just put a COMMA at the end of your print  command !!!

list:  using [] !!
	declare a list is just  
		varlist=['xx','yy']
	append list
		varlist.append('xxxx')
	sort a list
		varlist.sort()
	show a list member
		varlist[0]
	length
		len(varlist)
	delete one member
		del varlist[0]
	print 
		print varlist
	assign
		aaa=varlist[2]
    modify
        varlist[2]=xxx
    NOTE: can not modify after tail, only allow append

元组tuple:using () !! (元组不能改动！！)
	list in tuple , tuple in list , list in list , tuple in tuple all
	maintain their own apprearance , not merged
	a=('a','b','c')
	b=('d','e',a)
	then a have 3 menbers , b have 3 members too,
	b[2] is a(the whole), 
	b[2][0] is 'a', !!!!
	if tuple have no member , x=()
	if tuple have only one member x=(2,) , note the comma!!!

using tuple to print
	print '%s is %d'%(a,b)
	print '%s'%a  
	
	these two both valid, do not need comma
	


字典 {} 
	declare
		a={'a':'aa','b':'bb'}
			then a['a'] == 'aa'	
	append
		a['c']='cc'
	delete
		del a['d']
	for using:
		for c,d in a.items()  用来遍历

序列:
	1 just like list , you can list[1] list[2], list[2:3] list[2:-1], -1 is last, -2 is last second one
            list[1:] can show the last one
	2 applied to a string, then list[1] is just a character(：这个方法叫切片）
