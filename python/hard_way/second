input:
    raw_input() will get input as string using gnu's readline
		the trailing '\n' is dropped!!, 
		this take every input as string , so every thing can be receive
    input() will auto convert(cause security problem , do not use)
		input only can receive what python sync allowed, so string should wrapped by '', integer just input
		but in python3 this can used as raw_input too??
	autoident:
		raw_input will NOT auto ident after your prompt, so make a blank yourself

document:
	pydoc2: this search for a function in python2

from xxx import yyy :
	used to import class yyy from .py file xxx

function:
	def xxx():  
	param:  *arg means this argument is a list, 
			we can unpack using xxx,yyy,zzz= arg in function(number must match)
			pass:
				can pass string, var, calculation math
			default param can be used

	ATTENTION:
		start with 'def'
		name with chars and '_' only
		param inside () after name
		put ':' after ()
		ident lines in func using four tabs
		end a func by no identing
	run a func:
		type name (param1, param2)
	"To 'run,' 'call,' or 'use' a function all mean the same thing."

	calculate in func param:
		first left, then write(recusive is supported)

operator:
	+= -= *=   see pydoc2 +=
