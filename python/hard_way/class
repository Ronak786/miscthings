function in class should have first param: self !!!

class:
	attr  # this is class's global attr, can be accssed by every object
	self.attr #every obj's attr
	attrs may overide method, so
		prefix attr with an _
		method start with captal
		method use verbs
		attr use nonu

inhert:
	class aaa(modname.bbb)
	in cur class, just call baseclassname.func() to call basic class func(otherwise first search
		cur origin, then base)

isinstance(obj, classtype(like int)) will reutrn ture if cur class is type or derived from type
issubclass(obj, type)  obj is a subclass of xxx

iterators:
	everything which can be assigned to for xxx in yyy  have an __iter__()method 
		for will call iter() to get handler,  ,
	so define a __iter__ return self(class obj), then define next(),
		every time call,return a diff item, then done

generator:
	implement iterator more  convient:
		def fucn:
			in a loop:
				yield xxx
	every time yield, will stop, and next time call this func, will restart from there
	you do not need __iter__ and next() manually .
