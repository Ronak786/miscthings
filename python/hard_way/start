font format:(put this at top of file)
	#-*- coding: utf-8 -*-  can help you avoid ascii coding problem !!

do calculation in python env:
	vars should define first use  xxx=  

decimal:
	for positive, '/' just drop percents
	for negative, '/' represent percent always as positive, that is to say,
					-1.75 = -2 + 0.25 , so '/' will give you -2
