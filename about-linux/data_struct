align: = Min(biggest of data member type, struct default align size)
	this include you #pragma (packed) setted size, also should set use min(xx,xx)

	data struct member align use that struct's member's align size instead of struct size

thiscall:
	this method used to c++ call member function, 
	the first arg *this passed by register ecx, and pop from stack by the called function instead 
		of caller in usual normal function call!!

	we can also declare member fucntion as __stdcall(thiscall can not be used outside of c++ libs),
		*this will pass by stack instead of reg

		and __cdecl the caller responsible for balance the stack


argument pass:
	when pass object: copy object and do ctro(ifneeded) to that copied object, function return 
		then dtor that object
	when return object:
		first caller allocate on stack space to store tmp object, pass addr into calling func,
		calling func return will copy back to that addr, attention: this is tmp object addr:

		when tmpobject will be calcualated like func().xx.xx, or copy to some other caller's local location

		because passed in allocated space belongs to argument and belongs to calling func, 
			so should copy to a tmp object first !!!

pattern_recognize:
	if use [reg], [reg+4] .... to address value , maybe it is an object's this-> ...
	or mayby it is  array[xx]  if every member is same size

*this:
	ctor will return *this  in assembly
