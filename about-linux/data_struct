align: = Min(biggest of data member type, struct default align size)
	this include you #pragma (packed) setted size, also should set use min(xx,xx)

	data struct member align use that struct's member's align size instead of struct size

thiscall:
	this method used to c++ call member function, 
	the first arg *this passed by register ecx, and pop from stack by the called function instead 
		of caller in usual normal function call!!

	we can also declare member fucntion as __stdcall(thiscall can not be used outside of c++ libs),
		*this will pass by stack instead of reg

		and __cdecl the caller responsible for balance the stack
