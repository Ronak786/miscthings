	take package "one" and version 1.1 as example:
	create a dir one-1.1 under remotepkgs, in it, create dir src, put all files
		under "/" on destination device into dir src;
		then out of dir one, run ../makepkg.sh one-1.1 => now have a one-1.1.tar.gz
							 run ../signpkg.sh one-1.1 ==> now have a one-1.1.tar.gz.sig

		cd .. ; then add a line in remotepkg.txt as "name:xxx version:xxx desc:xxx"
		run ./makejson remote
