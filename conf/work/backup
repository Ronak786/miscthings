6737中使用了imageinfo类在bitmap中替代setconfig

dest:
    set listener on systemproperty
        init.h  property_changed will be called when set property 

        queue_builtin_action in init_parse add action to action list
            in name ,should  property:name=expected_value
            everytime catch, should reset

        property_set->property_changed->queue_property_triggers
            ->queue_proproty_triggers to queue action
                if value changed to that(then will be called)
            execute_one_command in main

    need to do:
        there are two properties, image and text
        add in init.rc a property listener, when change,
            call a function

        current process start threads show depend on property
            first check and set if show, then register signal,
            now sleep,
            whenever changed, the function called, send signal to 
            the process(thread should block all signals),
            process change show value, kill threads, start again

    chinese  wide char problem
