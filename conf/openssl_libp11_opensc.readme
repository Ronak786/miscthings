opensc has opensc-libpkcs.so  , this one have basic opensc functions libp11 will use
	so in libp11, you use functions in libp11.h, then they will connect to that opensc-libpkcs.so,
	see example dir in libp11 srcdir for detail usage

libp11 has engine libpkcs.so
	in openssl, you load engine, get method from engin, then it will auto call libp11 functions internally
	and realise functions of openssl in hardware
