priority in kernel reverse from in userspace ,
	we from 0 to 139, smaller , higher .
	nice from 100 to 139
	when a task created , 
	a normal process: static prio(created decicded) , normal prio(caculate decided) , prio(run time change)
				are same
	a real time process: normal prio will be 100 -1 - rt_priority value,prio not changed
	normal power up to real not changed
	
	when fork , new process's prio will be old's normal prio

runqueue:
	every schedule class's rq in a whole big rq defined by every cpu
	when enqueue, set weight depends on  priority,vruntime will depend on all these loads

schedule:
	periodic:  update clock , cpuload, run scheduler specific func to decide whether 
		scheduler needed , set needed reschedule needed
	main schedule( the schedule() ) , will check that flag every time return from 
		syscall or interrupt or ... , if needed , begin reschedule
		when success , we will change to new process , and continue run,
		when not needed , just return
