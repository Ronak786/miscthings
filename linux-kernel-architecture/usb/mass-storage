intruduce usb:
	a spec, define every device has device, config, interface , endpoint
	a intf relate to a driver, that's the key point, we deal with intf
	when register mass module, first read info from interface structure
	device structure into a private defined struct  us, (all infos are
	read out by usb core use fixd method by specification)
	then set endpoint(mass has two bulk ,one config, alternative interrupt)

one config transfer:
	begin by os, prepare config infos and send to device via usb_submit_urb(),into scsi layer!!
	(respect to spece),then wait(sleep,has timeout), then get info. this is 
	one transfer
	we use usb_stor_msg_common  usb_stor_control_msg transfer message host<->host-control<->device


during resource get , we start a thread control_thread, which will sleep,
	until one command is get from user , and wake up(command stored in 
	a structure stored in us struct, so thread can control)
