apm and acpi are two power manager subsystem, we now use acpi
	device model make power manager more convenient


generally have two operations: suspend, resume
	state: when suspending, do not transport data, dma, interrupt, accept request
	two power suspend mode:
	os layer: if os want to sleep, notify device and call their suspend func
	device layer: if device want to sleep ,just do it

have two type of suspend: STR STD  
	store to disk
	store to ram
	in /sys/power/disk we can echo in "shutdown" or "reboot"
	after that: echo disk > /sys/power/state (suspend)
	then your system's state will be stored to disk, if power on again,things are continued as same(resume)

every bus_type will have their own suspend and resume func, which will continue to traverse
	their subsystem's device driver to call those specific suspend func

take usb as an example:
	usb_suspend will suspend a device,and in that device's suspend,will suspend a interface
	and set that suspend state, after all intf, suspend that device
	if one stop error, resume all as if nothing happened

have several power state:
	on: after resume, normally run state
	suspend: low power not work state
	freeze: not work, used to take snapshot
	prethaw: just like freeze, but used to fix kexec bug, reset before resume
