once inset a device, sysfs will have at least two device model:
	the device itself, device's interface
	4-0:1.0  means  root hub 4's port0; use conf No.1 and interface No.0
		roob hub is on bus, every one has a number, its port(or its devpath from that root hub);
		then conf must choose one for whole device; then one intf for one function(eg.a mass storage)
usb_init:
	first create a work queue for powermanager(autosuspend)
	register bus,so we can add device on that bus 
	register host controller
	register usb bus as a char device
	register all usb devices possible as chrdevs
	register hub, usbfs, 
	then over
