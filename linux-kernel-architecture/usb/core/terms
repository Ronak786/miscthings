device driver <=> function
usb core      <=> usb device
hcd	      <=> usb interface

hcd is os's lowest layer , specific(keyboard, misc...)is the highest layer
usb core define some core functions that will be used by all others

so drivers only talk to usb_core, hcd only talk to usb core,servie it

hcd_pci:
	if pci is used, add this file's support, this and hcd.c together as the host controller's
		public portion,(private portion is uhci ehci xhci....)

__init: this means initcall
	initcall will be put in special section 
	and be called in in start_kernel
subsys_call: 
	this is a kind of module_init, but has a higher priority,
	these kinds of initcall used to set the sequence of subsystem and device's initialization sequence

var args:
	#define func(xxx,...)  func2(xxx,__VA_ARGS__)
	or define func(xxx, args...)  func2(xxx, ##args) the "##" will prevent a trailing ',' if no args is
		provided
