when startup
	in time_init, if hrtimer not available, i8254 will be activated as a truly low res timer.
		when hrtimer is enabled,first register clocksource,then clockregister,
			which will first set legacy timer(should be the hz jiffy timer ,in hres hardware),
			then in every tick periodic check, will check if hres mode now supported(or nohz mode),
			then if available, switch into hrtimer mode,
				this mode will emulate low res timer with one shot timer and
				 set forward a tick when in the current tick interrupt processing
