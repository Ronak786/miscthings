vimdiff , will show you two windows , you can modify , but not merge , use   ctrl+w+w to switch between

jump line  use :  linenumber+gg 



about to use  cscope :
	install cscope , and download the default setting: mkdir -p ~/.vim/plugin
								wget -P ~/.vim/plugin http://cscope.sourceforge.net/cscope_maps.vim

	in the dir including files , find . -type f -print | grep -E '\.(c(pp)?|h)$' > cscope.files
	then  cscope -bq ,   
	if you want to have cags in any dirs , set the $CSCOPE_DB  env  to that dir

about to use taglist 
	just intall , the .vim file will be in the system default place ,you can use with  :TlistToggle 
		you can also set shortcuts , like in root's vimrc


use vundle:
	 git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
	then  parse the default conf file , then you start a vim
		enter PluginInstall , wait for done , that's all!!
	all syntax in vundle is in the default  conf file , can download from  a lot of places
