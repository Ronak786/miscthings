namespace: 
	in a namespace , other things outside can not interfer with it, used by virtual machine as a container
	
memory space:
	virtual memory in 64bit will not all be used , to just 40~50bit is enough , and save cpu overload ,
		so have holes in memory pagetable

into kernel method:
	user space syscall
	interrupt from hardware
	kernel threads being run by schedule? ps will show like [XXX/1] means XXX threads run on cpu 1

page and tlb :
	page have herichy , PGD PMD PTE offset , tlb will be flushed every time page table changed , cpu do it or kernel 
		do it ----arch diffs
	
	kernel will always assume  four level page table , sometimes ignore some level , but it is the kernel portion related
		to arch do that , the general part assume four

memory mapping:
	kernel maintain the mapping , others can just access memory , the change will be auto sent to device or file

memory alloca:
	brother system : 
		kernel have a lager contigous chunk of memory, when needed a small one , break into half ,
			if just between half and double half , alloc to him. if not ,continue to break to half,
			then when recycle , if address is contigous , merge to double.(but if frenquently allocated,
				can make scattered )
	slab : 
		this is defined above the brother system , can cache a chunk of memory to allocate small memories
			for structures and so on,  using for example: kmalloc kfree 
	page fault and recycle:
		swap be used to store tmp not used pages , recycle is when memory needed , flush data and recycle
			pages , just mark as page fault on the virtual page(physical page recycled)
