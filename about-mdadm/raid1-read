write before all:
	in run , wake up thread , will wake up the registered thread : rai1d
	in raid1d , md_check_recovery will be called
	in that , md_start_sync called
	in that , md_do_sync registerred and then be called ( every time in this func)


what does raid1d do:
	after flush pending writes  , then do with retry list
	it has four  state can do things 
		if r1bio is sync ,
			if  write error or made good , handle sync write finished
			else     sync_request_write
		if not sync
			 if error or make good , handle write finish
			then if  read error , read narror and report error if needed
			else  just send read request to sub devs

handle_sync_write_finished : ( this will be called by raid1d ,when is in sync and we have made good(can clear bad
		blocks ) or we have write error
	used to be called when sync write is finished , 
	check  if is uptodate : is , then if can clear bad blocks , just clear them
	check   if  not uptodata and has write error , is ,  just set badblocks , if failed , report error

handle_write_finished : (called by raid1d when not in sync and have made good or write error):
	loop for every rdev
		if made good , clear badblocks
		if have write error ( the result bio not NULL ) , use  narror write to write and mark bad blocks
			or mark  degrade if needed
		then end and close write
	sync over , sub the sync block nums and  
	use put_buf to: first test fault flag, second  if no pendings , then set recovery needed , call raid1d ,
			then  :  allow barrier

handle_sync_write:
	this is used to do sync write , write will be written to all synced disks
	

		
	

in raid1 read:
	first : md_write_start  usd for: flush super block
		details:if not write -> return
			if read only -> report bug  , return
			if ro==2 , it's a flag of restart? , so recover needed , set to 0 ,and flush with thread , 
				flush sync with  sync_thread
				
				in mddev->thread(which is raid1d): 
					md_check_recovery( set bits and call recovery):check  not need recovery state  , then return
						if read only , we just add spare disks and finish sync request and return
						if we change flags , we must set did change so to notify /sys
						if need update superblock  , update
				     loop:
					then flush_pending_writes in conf->pendinglist, which are nornal  writes bios
						they will be send to disk seperately by make generic request
					
					then  do with  r1_bio retrylist , every loop will only extract one  r1bio reqeust 
						check the request's flag to determineo
						details:  if is sync , then clear bad blocks or set badblock
					then return
			if not ro , just set sync=0 , then set changed flag and call raid1d to sync
			then notify  sys
			wait until no changes , then return

	second : copy bio struct into a ribio struct , 

  now analyse read:
		first we are in read_balance to  select a disk to read from( all are mirrored) 
			no flags set in this func
		details:
		   traverse all rdevs
			if recovery check point is less than the write origin , then may be overlapped,
				we will choose the first available one to use
			if disk is not in well to be read  state or origin is in resync , just skip
			if we  meet a writemostly disk(which is slow) , we just choose the first one in this type
				and only if no other type has been picked ,then test bad blocks and 
				set available num of blocks can be read ,then continue
			if we encounter normal disks , we test if have bad blocks
				if first bad before start , then calculate how many bad blocks after start ,
					we set that as the max  blocks can be read ,then continue
				if first after start , then calculate their distance,that is the max should be read
					and if choose first , just choose that disk , else continue
				if no bad blocks , just assign best good blocks as the whole required size
			after that , if havn't chosen , then if solid disks , if sequence , just choose that ,
				else ,if satisfy some condition ,not choose yet , just set choose next idle and continue
			if pending is 0 , just choose that,
			compare distance ,and update the best if needed
		    traverse over here
		if have no best disk , choose the best nearest one
		now we have one chosen disk , we test if it is ok to be read , if not , again begin the loop
		update the rdev's next seq sec or seq start ,return the best disk and the sectors allowed for read

		second we make some test , if rdev not exist , just return end
		then  make a r1 bio struct  ,  if sectors not enough , we call retry and use raid1d to deal with that,
			then again begin read from other disks(choose again)
						if enough , just make generic request

   now analyse write ( read and write are separete)
		if pending writes are too many , wake up  raid1d to flush writes
	        traverse all disks (by 2 times disks)
		details:
			if have blocked devices, break out and wait for that complete , then make sure 
				all sync place is synced , then start the loop from the head again
			if rdev not exist ( if in the first disks numbers(not in mirrors) , mark degrade),skip that disk
			set write pending
			if  rdev has unacknownalegded  block or bad , set and wait and then again loop
			if first bad is before frist , then all must less then the bad region , and not set that rdev in r1bio
			if first bad is after first , then all must also less than the good
		loop-end (this loop used to determine how many sectors can be written)
	
		then the second loop:
		detail:
			for every rdev , make a bio struct and add to the conf->pending list , then call wake up thread
				use raid1 to flush that to disk
		end-loop
		if we have remain sectors not written , allocate another r1bio and go to the beginning place to write again
	now over
